User Story:
The sidebar background color should be Electromagnetic color (HEX: #2f3640)
The sidebar width is fixed in 250px and the height is full based on the screen size (viewport)
The image width has to be fit with the sidebar width
For each menu, use 0.5em for top & bottom margin and 1em for left & right margin
Each menu will have 0.5em of padding
The menu text has to be bold
When hovered, the link of the menu has a suttle black overlay on its background to separate the menu item from the background 

Hint: 

To make an element size full based on the screen size 
use viewport height (vh) or viewport width (vw) as size unit.
